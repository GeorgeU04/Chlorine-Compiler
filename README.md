# Chlorine-Compiler
I am attempting to teach myself how to build a compiler from scratch in C. The programming language I am making the compiler for is called Chlorine which will have basically the exact same syntax as C. It will probably take a while to build however I will be uploading all the major progress milestones as I complete them.
